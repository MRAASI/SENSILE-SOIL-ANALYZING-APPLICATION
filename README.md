# SENSILE-SOIL-ANALYZING-APPLICATION---ML-

This project mainly focuses on the how the soil condition can be predicted by using some related information and recommends the crop to the user. It mainly depends on the soil metrics. The scope of this site is the user can able to predicting the soil condition and the crop which can be planted.


The dataset used in this project is Crop_recommendation dataset . The dataset contains 9 attributes which are used to predict the crop and soil condition such as:
N – Nitrogen,
P – Phosphorus,
K - Calcium,
temperature – Temperature,
humidity - Humidity,
ph - ph value of soil,
rainfall - Rainfall,
label - crop,
soil – soil

THE TARGET VARIABLES ARE :
label - crop recommendation,
soil   - soil condition 



The Target Variables are :

1.	label   --- crop -(crop.pkl)
2.	soil     ----  soil condition -(soil.pkl)

The directory consists of 
1.	app.py
2.	Template folder 
3.	Model folder consists of pkl files
4.	Dataset consists of considered dataset which is crop_recommendation.csv
